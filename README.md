# ASSESSING MULTIFACETED RETRIEVAL STRATEGIES IN THE MEDICAL DOMAINS

## Introduction

This repository contains the research work for the thesis "Evaluating Multifaceted Retrieval Strategies in Open-Domain Question Answering". The study explores various retrieval techniques in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, focusing on open-domain datasets. Our work compares different retrieval strategies and evaluates their performance using traditional metrics.

## Experiments

Our research included the following key experiments:

## Code Availability

**Note:** Due to intellectual property considerations, the full implementation of the code is not currently publicly available. However, we are committed to open science and reproducibility. The complete codebase is scheduled to be released within one year from the thesis publication date.

We appreciate your understanding and patience. Once released, the code will provide comprehensive details of our implementation, allowing for reproduction and extension of our work.

## Future Updates

Stay tuned for updates on code release and additional resources. We encourage you to "watch" this repository for notifications.
